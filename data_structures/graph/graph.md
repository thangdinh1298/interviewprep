# Graph representations
## Adjacency list
Space complexity O(V+E)
## Adjacency matrix
Space complexity O(V^2)
## Edge list
Space complexity O(E)
# Graph properties
- Maximum number of edges in an undirected graph nC2 = O(V^2)
- Maximum number of edges in a directed graph nA2 = 2 * nC2 = O(V^2)
- For sparse graph where E << V^2, the adjacency list representation if more space efficient
- For dense graph, an adjacency matrix is also good
